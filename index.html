            Exploring the concept of artist expression, practice, expertise, perception and freedom through this website. A website that allows a personal use of the online platform to allow artists to communicate to potential audience or buyers. This website is what can allow all artists to portray the ongoing issues prevalent to our day, demonstrate personal views, advocate and promote causes and topics, and protect and provide a space for development. The website will act as a curator of an art gallery. This gallery will be called “The Artist Feed”. The artist feed has the initiative to convey the lack of appreciation with the artistic expression to interpret timely matters. It will allow connection between many talented and wise artists. As the name suggests, this online art gallery will consist of carefully and passionately selected art pieces from various artists around the world.

            "How often can you look at the mountains around here and not be bored? How long can you sit by the shore of a lake and look out at the water and not feel bored? How frequently can you see a sunset and still be thrilled with it? There is something in the natural world, the God-made world, that knows how to speak to our souls in a way that human technology never can... there is something in us that, when we have some free time, makes us want to go up to the mountains. We want to watch the sunset. We want to sit by the shore and look at the water. Something tells us, “This defines your place in the universe.” It gives us the reassuring message that when we have reached the limits of human power and knowledge, there is a greater power that begins where ours leaves off."

            The Artist Feed is purposely created for all, as it challenges individuals, both the artist and the audience. It will be great to receive feedback whether the audience who have a specific set of beliefs concerning the context and meaning of the artworks will value how it has been interpreted by the artists. The audience will be able to explore the artist’s art, a mock-up display of the art (if being sold), the artist statement and artist background. They can send feedback, contact the artist and make a bid on a specific artwork. These feedback may be posted on the website.
